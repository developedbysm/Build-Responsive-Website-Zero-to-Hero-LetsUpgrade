                    Data visualization is the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, 
                    trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed.
                    Python offers multiple great graphing libraries that come packed with lots of different features. No matter 
                    if you want to create interactive, live or highly customized plots python has an excellent library for you.

                    To get a little overview here are a few popular plotting libraries:
                    Matplotlib: low level, provides lots of freedom
                    Pandas Visualization: easy to use interface, built on Matplotlib
                    Seaborn: high-level interface, great default styles
                    ggplot: based on Râ€™s ggplot2, uses Grammar of Graphics
                    Plotly: can create interactive plots
                </p>

                    Research into how people read and misread various types of visualizations 
                    is helping to determine what types and features of visualizations are most 
                    understandable and effective in conveying information.
